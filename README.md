# SiREN v2.0
## _The Similarity Retrieval Engine v2.0_

SIREN is a *middleware* software for Relational Database Management Systems proposed by [Barioni et al. (2006)][sirenpaper]. SIREN's core ideas are *(i)* the seamlessly extension of the SQL language towards similarity searching, and *(ii)* the definition of a proper extension for *selection* and *join* operators. Such concepts were further extended by [theoretical][sirenopt] and [experimental][medfmisir] studies. 

The first SIREN implementation provides an extension for DDL commands involving attributes compared by similarity as well as an interpreter for `SELECT` commands whose *selection* predicates involving similarity were solved by the interpreter and translated into `IN`-list conditions. The SIREN implementation in this repository:

1. Modifies the [SIREN grammar][newgrammar];
2. Adds support for sub-selects (See [query examples][examples]);
3. Adds support for [diversified similarity searching][divsearch] predicates;
4. Provides a client-server implementation for running SIREN over underlying DBMSs' [MySQL][mysql] and [SQLite][sqlite]. 

## Features

- Client-server implementation (through QTCP and QSQL)
- Querying support for MySQL and SQLite
- Support for multidimensional feature vectors
- Support for multiple distance functions
- Support for metric indexes
- Support for similarity searching
-- *k*-Nearest Neighbors queries
-- Range queries
- Support for diversified similarity searching
-- BRID queries
-- BRIDGE queries
- ✨Combine order and identity predicates with distance-based conditions!✨


> SIREN assumes similarity predicates have execution priority (written order). Therefore, mind issuing non-comutative conditions carefully (*e.g.*, kNN), or use nested subselects to fix the execution order for inner->outer conditions.

## Background technologies and 3rd-party libraries

Siren relies on a series of background technologies and 3rd-party libraries to work properly, namely:

1. Background technologies

- [Qt SDK][qt] - Qt Cross-Platform and SDK C++ development environment.
- [Agathon library][agathon] - Self contained library with tokenizer and interpreter for similarity searching predicates.

2. 3rd-party libraries

- [Hermes][hermes] - Our own C++ library of distance functions (and utils).
- [Arboretum (forked)][arbforked] - A forked version of the Arboretum library for metric indexing that supports BRIDGE (master [here][arboretum])


## Installation

1. Install the background technologies and download the source code of 3rd-party libraries.
Then, adjust the include paths of `siren.pro.example` file to point to the installation folders of the 3rd-party libraries and rename it to `siren.pro`.
After that, you can use `build.sh` to compile the server version.

```sh
cd siren
./build.sh && make clean
```

2. Run the compiled binary by providing the server ip, port, and the DBMS type and user (*e.g.*, localhost server running on port 3434 for MySQL with user 'user').
```sh
cd build-siren #your compiled binary folder location
./Siren-Server -u user -p 3434 -h localhost -d mysql  #requires mysql to be installed
#./Siren-Server -u user -p 3434 -h localhost          #requires sqlite to be installed
```

> SIREN over SQLite does not offer support diversified similarity searching because SQLite interpreter does not hande double IN-list conditions.

3. Run the [Siren DDL script][sirenddl] by issuing the DDL commands though a client (*e.g.*, telnet) for the server.
> You can use a simple telnet connection (i.e., telnet <siren-server-ip> <siren-server-port>) to submit the DDL script that contains standard SQL commands for the creation of SIREN internal tables.

## Directory structure

The directory tree is structured as follows.

| Dir | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| root  | Main functionalities and util. |
| example | Include examples and cases of use for SIREN. |
| 3rd-party  | Includes the entry points for 3rd-party libraries. |
| ddl | Includes the DDL script for SIREN instantion.  |


## Development

Future directions for SIREN includes adding support to [Apache Impala][impala] and the extension of its query language interpreter to [Apache Thrift][thrift].
